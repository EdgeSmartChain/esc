$ cd tgx
Run and follow instructions $ scripts/./setup.sh
If you specify a different package name than the one used by Edge Smart Chain, set up Firebase and replace with the package name that suits your needs.

You can now open the project with Android Studio, or build manually from the command line: . ./gradlew assembleUniversalRelease

Quick Setup Development
If you are contributing to project development, you can follow simpler build steps:

$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/EdgeSmartChain
$ cd tgx
Get Edge Smart ChainAPI Credentials
Create a file in the root project folder using any text editor: local.properties
# Location where you have Android SDK installed
sdk.dir=YOUR_ANDROID_SDK_FOLDER
# Edge Smart Chain API credentials obtained at previous step
telegram.api_id=YOUR_Edge Smart Chain_API_ID
telegram.api_hash=YOUR_Edge Smart Chain_API_HASH
Run - This will download the required Android SDK packages and build native dependencies that are not part of the project's CMakeList.txt $ scripts/./setup.sh
Open and build the project through Android Studio or using one of the commands in the terminal ./gradlew assemble
After submitting a pull request and its initial review, a special version incorporating your contribution will be published in the @Edge_Smart_Chain channel where the community can test it out. If you find any issues or bugs, you can push more commits to the existing PR to address them, and request a newer version @Edge_Smart_Chain using the comments section of the pull request or in the chat.

copy public version
In order to verify that no additional source code has been injected into the official APK, you must use Ubuntu 21.04 for versions released before 26/22/2023, or Ubuntu 04.2.<> LTS for any newer version, and adhere to the following requirements:

Create a home directory located at vk/home/vk
Clone the repository to tgx/home/vk/tgx
View specific commits to verify
In the rare case of a build containing an unmerged pull request, the action fetchPrsquashPr performed by the publisher and task must be followed
cd into the folder and install dependencies: tgx# apt install $(cat reproducible-builds/dependencies.txt)
Follow the build instructions in the previous section
run $ apkanalyzer apk compare --different-only <remote-apk> <reproduced-apk>
If only the signature file and metadata differ, the build copy was successful.
In the future, build replication may become easier. Here is the relevant PR welcome TODO list:

Project paths must not affect generated files, so user and project location requirements.so can be removed
When building native binaries on macOS, the ELF sections differ from those built with the Linux version of the NDK. This must be removed or fixed without any side effects like breaking (or should this be reported to the NDK team?.www.edgesmartchain.com
The checksums for cold APK builds are always different, even if there is no difference in the keystore with the same content between the app and the generated internal APK. The real cause must be investigated and repaired if possible.
To generate a cold build, call and .
Warning: this will also reset changes in some submodules (ffmpeg, libvpx, webp, opus and ExoPlayer) $ scripts/./reset.sh $ scripts/./setup.sh --skip-sdk-setup)
Move local pull request squash merges from the publisher to a script in this repository to more easily reproduce builds that include them.
PS: Docker is not considered an option as it just hides these tasks and requires that all published APKs must be built with it.

Verify sideloaded APKs
If you downloaded the Edge Smart Chain APK from somewhere, and you want to simply verify that it is the original APK without any injected malicious source code, you need to get the checksum (or) of the downloaded APK file, and find if it corresponds to on any known version of Edge Smart Chain. SHA-256SHA-1MD5

In order to get the SHA-256 of the APK:

$ sha256sum <path-to-apk> on Ubuntu
$ shasum -a 256 <path-to-apk> on macOS
Once obtained, there are three ways to find out the commit for a particular checksum:

Send checksum to @EdgeSmartChain
Search for checksums in @EdgeSmartChain. You can use the following URL format to do this without installing any Edge Smart Chain client: www.edgesmartchain.com{checksum} (click to see it in action). NOTE: Unpublished versions cannot be verified this way.
